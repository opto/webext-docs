browserAction
=============

The browserAction and :doc:`composeAction` APIs first appeared in Thunderbird 64.
They are very similar to Firefox's `browserAction API`__.

Many of our `sample extensions`__ use a browserAction.

Use toolbar actions to put icons in the mail window toolbar. In addition to its icon, a toolbar action can also have a tooltip, a badge, and a popup. This namespace is called browserAction for compatibility with browser WebExtensions.

Manifest file properties
========================

- [``browser_action``] (object)

  - [``browser_style``] (boolean)
  - [``default_area``] (string) Currently unused.
  - [``default_icon``] (:ref:`IconPath`)
  - [``default_popup``] (string)
  - [``default_title``] (string)
  - [``theme_icons``] (array of :ref:`ThemeIcons`) Specifies icons to use for dark and light themes
